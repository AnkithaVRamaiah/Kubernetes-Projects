### Project Name: **Kubernetes Pod Deployment on Minikube**

Here is a step-by-step guide for practicing Kubernetes with Minikube, including prerequisites, installation, and expected outputs.

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Minikube**:
   - Download and install Minikube from [Minikube Releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases).
   - Ensure that **Docker** is installed and running for Minikube to create the Kubernetes cluster.
   
2. **Install kubectl**:
   - Download and install `kubectl` from [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

3. **Ensure Virtualization is Enabled**:
   - Minikube requires virtualization support on your system (e.g., Hyper-V or VirtualBox).

### Steps

1. **Start Minikube Cluster**:
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     - Minikube will download necessary images and set up the Kubernetes cluster.
     - You should see messages indicating the cluster is being created, including the Docker environment being set up.

2. **Check Minikube Version**:
   ```bash
   minikube version
   ```
   - **Expected Output**: 
     ```
     minikube version: v1.34.0
     ```

3. **Check Kubernetes Pods**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```
     No resources found in default namespace.
     ```

4. **Create a Pod**:
   - Create a `pod.yaml` file with the following content (example for an Nginx pod):

   - Apply the pod configuration:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
     ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```
     pod/myapp created
     ```

5. **Check Pod Status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```
   - After a few seconds:
 
     - **Expected Output**:
       ```
       NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
       myapp   1/1     Running   0          3m11s
       ```

6. **Get More Detailed Information About the Pod**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```
     NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
     myapp   1/1     Running   0          3m28s   10.244.0.4   minikube   <none>           <none>
     ```

7. **Access Minikube's VM (SSH)**:
   - If you encounter the "Access is denied" error, ensure your permissions for the `id_rsa` file are correct or run the terminal as Administrator.
   - Try accessing the Minikube VM:
     ```bash
     minikube ssh
     ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     If successful, youâ€™ll be logged into the Minikube VM.
   
8. **Access the Nginx Pod**:
   - Run `curl` from inside Minikube's SSH session:
     ```bash
     curl 10.244.0.4
     ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
     <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
     ...
     </html>
     ```

9. **Logout from Minikube's VM**:
   ```bash
   logout
   ```

### Expected Outcomes:
- Minikube successfully starts and sets up the Kubernetes cluster.
- Pods can be created and their status can be monitored.
- SSH into the Minikube VM is successful, allowing you to interact with the container and access the Nginx server.

These steps should help practice the basic operations of Kubernetes with Minikube.
